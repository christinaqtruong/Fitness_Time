# General Idea:
An online timer for working out used for setting up workout and rest intervals that start and stop automatically and which can sync to music sourced from SoundCloud

#Target Audience:
People who use interval training as part of their workout regimen

#Primary Problem:
Interval training requires a set workout period followed by a rest interval, which requires having at least two timers set to different time durations and switching between the two. 

#Primary Goal:
This app aims to avoid having to reset the timer in order to switch between the different durations to provide a seamless transition between rest and workout periods that can be repeated automatically for the duration of the exercise.
